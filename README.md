## One Page Project Site

This page is an example of the webpage I created in the HTML course. Starting with an HTML skeleton and using CSS I was able to style the navbar, headers and the area around them, images and form controls. 

## Space Station Site
This page is an example home page for a Space travel company. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image container, and a form.

## Movie Theater Site
This page is an example home page for a Movie theater that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.

## Portfolio Site
This page is the website for my perosnal portfolio. Using a basic layout I was able to use CSS to change the colors, video, images, padding and navbar of the site.
